| 139 | Bruce       | “We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2   |

| 141 | Cynthia     | A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him. | 3   |
| 142 | Randy       | “My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.                                   | 5   |
| 143 | Philip      | “It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 6   |
| 144 | Jacob       | “John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”                                | 9   |
| 145 | Benjamin    | “Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 9   |
| 146 | Frances     | “Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o’clock?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 12  |
| 147 | Helen       | “You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 12  |
| 148 | Brittany    | “I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”                                                 | 14  |
| 149 | Sharon      | “It surprised me.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 14  |
| 150 | Gerald      | We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 14  |

They did not know how to look.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 22  |
| 154 | Samuel      | “Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. “Pray continue your very interesting statement.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 22  |
| 155 | Christopher | He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.                                                                                            | 23  |
| 156 | Steven      | “No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 26  |
| 157 | Charlotte   | “He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’                                                                                                                            | 27  |
| 158 | Jose        | “Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 28  |
| 159 | Eugene      | “I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 28  |
| 160 | Barbara     | “You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 28  |
| 161 | Ruth        | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 28  |
| 162 | Eugene      | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 28  |
| 163 | Raymond     | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 28  |
| 191 | Lily        | Our neighboring courthouse has a very annoying rooster that crows loudly at 6am every day. My sons Robert and Patrick took the rooster to a city far, far away, so it may never bother us again. My sons have successfully arrived in Paris.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 28  |
